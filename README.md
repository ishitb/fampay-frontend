# Fampay Externship - Frontend Assignment
# Contextual Cards built with ReactJS

## Description
A Frontend App ( Mobile View ) to display contextual cards
Develop a React App, that displays a list of Contextual Cards
A Contextual Card is used to refer to a view that is rendered using json from an API
These views are dynamic and their properties like images, colour, texts, buttons (CTAs) etc. can be changed from the backend at any time.

The app renders the contextual cards in a list based on the API response that we get from the [API](https://run.mocky.io/v3/04a04703-5557-4c84-a127-8c55335bb3b4)

The design is based on this [Figma Page](https://www.figma.com/file/AvK2BRGwMTv4kQab5ymJ0K/AAL3-%3A-Android-assignment-Design-Specs)
